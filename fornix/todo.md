- DONE Get signature CLI tool working
- Finalize the structure:
  - flavors are numbered and are "owned" 
    - most fields are mutable
    - they represent a single document in the search index
  - instances are not owned, can be published by anyone
  - search is
    - 1. by name
    - 2. by blurb (if more than one result)
    - 3. by flavorNumber+advertiser (if more than one result)
    - 4. by version (filtered by adjectives)
    - 5. by hash (if more than one)
    - 6. list all sources
- Try publishing a module to the database server
- Try unpublishing to the database server
    - will need to edit storage system to keep track of who adds what info
