db system:
    - submissions: just every publish as-is in a content-addressed folder and put in an unprocessed folder
    - tool index:
        tool name
        entityUuid
        tool keywords
        tool blurb
        tool description
    - versions:
        every tool name + allResults gets a file that contains adjectives and versioned information
        once some tool-results are populated, then this file is loaded for adjective-refinement followed by listing of versions and sources
