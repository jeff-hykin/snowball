- define the submission format
- rescrape the data in the new format
- create and update the index with the new information

- federation plan:
    - create one big repo that imports all the little ones
    - for every package create a folder
        - create an entry in the big repo that imports this one and overlays it with all the changes in the big repo
        - create a package.nix, have it look like a flake
            - as input, have the current folder/system
            - as output
                - import the package from the existing nixpkgs url
                - overlay it with anything in the current system
        - create a tools.nix for exporting nix-functions instead of derivations
        - copy the source file (probably default.nix) to the same directory
        - create a conversion-help.nix that tries to convert the args of a default.nix function into a flake-like format
        - create an `examples.nix`
        - create `metadata/`
        
    - have the search results
        - buttons for:
            - install to system
            - install to project
            - use inside a nix file (hover/click=>copy-paste)
        - have all those^ link to the branches instead of nixpkgs directly
