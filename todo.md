- for every package create a folder
    - create a package.nix, have it look like a flake
        - as input, have the current folder/system
        - as output
            - import the package from the existing nixpkgs url
            - overlay it with anything in the current system
    - create a tools.nix for exporting nix-functions instead of derivations
    - copy the source file (probably default.nix) to the same directory
    - create a conversion-help.nix that tries to convert the args of a default.nix function into a flake-like format
    - create an `examples.nix`
    - create `metadata/`
- create one big repo that imports all the little ones
- have the search results
    - buttons for:
        - install to system
        - install to project
        - use inside a nix file (hover/click=>copy-paste)
    - have all those^ link to the branches instead of nixpkgs directly
