- create a rust cargo package that builds a binary that wraps that ^ command up for snowballs (get the snowball, get package0, build the derivation, then install the derivation)
- write a script in deno for bumping the info.toml verison and adding git tags
- start a package index system by downloading everyones repo, scanning for git tags, and then adding the package/info.toml at that point to a folder, then running an automated indexer on all the toml files
- have the index search spit out a snowball URL once its found
- (DONE)
